# Before building Cusp using Ant, you need to create a site.properties file in the build directory that contains 
# configuration info for your current environment.  Here's a sample site.properties file, appropriate for a 
# typical Mac OS X system:
#
# # Path to Eclipse application root; needed for building the compile-time classpath
# eclipse.home = /Applications/eclipse-3.2/
# # Path to SBCL's lib directory; this is copied into the release directory for the indicated platform.
# # possible property names for each platform are: sbcl.lib.osx.ppc, sbcl.lib.osx.intel, sbcl.lib.windows, sbcl.lib.linux
# sbcl.lib.osx.ppc = /usr/local/lib/sbcl/
# # Path to SBCL's executable; this is copied into the sbcl lib directory that is copied into the
# # 	release directory for the indicated platform.
# # possible property names for each platform are: sbcl.exe.osx.ppc, sbcl.exe.osx.intel, sbcl.exe.windows, sbcl.exe.linux
# sbcl.exe.osx.ppc = /usr/local/bin/sbcl
