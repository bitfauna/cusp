1.0.0, TBD

    * Tons of bugs squashed
    
    * Editor (and repl) improvements:
        - Another level of highlighting of s-expression
        - Added option to change default color
        - Now indent line is Ctrl-Tab, while Tab indents whole top level sexp.
        - New feature: auto edits.
        - Improved indentation.
        - Added several actions to LispEditor context menu.
        - Added a few more words to highlight as important Lisp words
        - Fined tuned pair auto edits and expand selection
      
    * Repl
        - Fixed up the repl toolbar to only show buttons relevant to the current state
        - Now Repl displays CL version, Cusp version and current package in status bar
        - When a package is loaded, repl prints notification message.
        - Repl's sash now behaves in a more robust way - keeps both history and repl visible.
        - Undo (Ctrl+z) now works in Repl
        - Ctrl+click (find definition) now works in Repl
        - Autocompletions are off, when in Read mode
        - "Use Ctrl+Enter" preference has no effect when in Read mode: Hitting Enter always sends results to Lisp.
      
    * Improved work with lisp implementations:
        - Added ability to use remote Slime over SSH
        - Improvement in handling clisp
        - Lisp welcome message now is more reliable
        - Lisp startup and shut down now should be more robust (but still there is room for improvement)
        - Communication code is greatly improved, which should result in quicker and more reliable connection to lisp (through swank)
        - Fixed bug: When CL quits with fatal error (like when heap is exhausted) Cusp does not notice it. Now REPL shows Disconnected message and reconnect button shows that it is disconnected.
      
    * Improved library/package management system
        - More robust library finding code
    
    * Wizards
        - When a new project is made, the REPL will now automatically switch to that project's package
        - New Project now does some cleaning to project names to make sure they form a valid package
        - Added some comments into the default generated files to explain their purpose better
        - Added options in Create Lisp Project wizard to create tests.lisp file and generate an example function with its test.
        - New wizard: create executable (sbcl only)
      
    * Outline
        - Fixed many bugs to make outline robust
        - Cache outline quick-tips request to significantly reduce swanking (communication with lisp)
      
    * Improved and new development tools
        - Fixed a lot of bugs dealing with compilation warnings and errors
        - Made message for undefined variable produced by SBCL prettier. 
        - Fixed couple bugs in Compile on save mode.
        - Profiler now is a little bit more intuitive (little tweak)
        - Improved debugger:
            - Forcing the debug label not to exceed 50px in height 
            - Stepping support
            - View locals and find source are more robust now
            - Debugger now correctly handles multiple levels (conditions thrown while in the debugger)
            - Debugger correctly handles multi-threading (when it's invoked by hunchentoot, say)
            - New feature: Added breakpoints and tracing macros and added easy way to add/remove them in code.
            - When debugger is invoked with (break) default restart selection is "[CONTINUE] Return from BREAK", rather than "[ABORT] Return to SLIME's top level."
            - Cleaned up debug clutter by hiding swank frames in debugger backtraces (optional - can set to off in preferences)
        - New feature: integrated unit testing (see tutorial).
      
    * Quick assist improvements
        - Fixed several bugs in fuzzy autocompletions
        - Fixed several bugs in hyperlinks, to improve find definition feature
        - Made apropos results read-only
        - Made showing and hiding popups more robust
      
    
    * Improved code analysis
        - Fixed bugs in FindCallees and FindCallers
        - Results of FindCallees and FindCallers are now shown in new Xref View rather than in modal dialog box.
    
    * Improved Navigator
        - Renamed 'Load asd' to 'Load Project.' This terminology make more sense to newbs
        - Load Project action now works on any file in the project, searching out an asd file on its own
    
    * Other improvements
        - When diffing or merging files with team support, lisp files are now color formatted.
        - Used FilteredList in package dialogs, so searching for library or package is easier now
        - Removed SecondaryReplViewer
        - Preferences are improved and many now work without restarting.
        - Rearranged Lisp menu and changed some keybindings.
