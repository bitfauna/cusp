These steps should be automated sometime, but now it all goes as follows:

1. Check out the following projects into Eclipse:
  - cusp_update
  - jasko.tim.lisp
  - jasko.tim.lisp.feature
  - jasko.tim.lisp.libs
  - jasko.tim.lisp.libs.feature
  - sbcl-linux
  - sbcl-linux.feature
  - sbcl-ocx
  - sbcl-ocx.feature
  - sbcl-win32
  - sbcl-win32.feature
  - sbcl.installer
  
2. If sbcl.installer is modified, then open its manifest.mf and select Export wizard.
Export to jar file and copy that file to sbcl-linux.feature, sbcl-osx.feature and 
sbcl-win32.feature as sbcl.installer.jar

3. If one of plugins is changed, it is required to change version number of
its corresponding feature and that feature with new version added to site.xml
in cusp_update.

4. To update site cusp_update, go to site.xml and hit Build all.
