* Version 0.5, released 12-01-2006

The README contains a few examples of the library's use.

** bugfixes

Several bugs have been fixed with this release.  The file buffering
code, a source of bugs in the past, has been completely re-written.

** new features

ARCHIVE now understands GNU-style "long filename" and "long linkname"
entries in tar files.

CLISP is now a supported implementation for creating archives.  Other
relevant fixes for CLISP have been made as well.  (Thanks to Magnus
Henoch.)

CMUCL is now a supported implementation for creating archives.

Accessing the data associated with an archive entry has been revamped
thanks to the use of Edi Weitz's FLEXI-STREAMS library.  Please see
the documentation string for ENTRY-STREAM for an explanation and the
example of its use in the README file.

* Version 0.3.1, released 11-02-2005

** new features

Sean Ross contributed a compatibility layer for Lispworks as well as
some other small fixes.

* Version 0.2, released 05-01-2004

ARCHIVE no longer comes in a single 'tar.lisp' file, instead being
split across multiple files and tied together with an ASDF file, as
is standard for Common Lisp projects nowadays.

** new features

Support for reading cpio archives.  The input layer was rewritten
somewhat to support this, but the output layer has not yet had the
corresponding changes made.  Old-style and SVR4-style cpio archives are
supported.
